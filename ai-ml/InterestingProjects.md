# AI-based Projects/Tools to Explore

## [watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate)
Quote "IBM® watsonx™ Orchestrate® puts AI to work—helping you build, deploy and manage powerful AI assistants and agents that automate workflows and processes with generative AI.

Seamlessly integrate with your existing business systems. Connect to any AI model or automation tool. Enable collaboration between your AI assistants and agents in one unified experience.

The outcome? Less manual work. Faster decisions. A more efficient business—at scale."

Looks like a tool suite for building AI agents and workflows.

## [Ascendion](https://ascendion.com/)
Seems to be a company focussed on consulting across a wide range of functionality.

We had a demo of their [Ava+](https://ascendion.com/how-we-deliver/ascendion-ava/) product suite.  Looks like it is a service they run, I assume with consulting support, which provides integration of LLMs and guardrails for managing them and a suite of tools for running agents and workflows as well as front-ends for managing product, development, etc.  Includes both a plugin for dev IDEs as well as workflows for application transformations.

## MPC & A2A Orchestration
 - [MPC - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) Open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs.
 - A2A - Agent to Agent protocol

## Google Jules
 [Jules](https://jules.google.com/task) is an experimental coding agent from Google.  Can be used to run coding tasks against a Github project.

## [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/en)
AI-assisted IDE that Richard Pickett likes
## [Windsurf] (https://codeium.com/windsurf)
Another AI-assisted IDE

## [Void](https://github.com/voideditor/void)
Void is the open-source Cursor alternative.
