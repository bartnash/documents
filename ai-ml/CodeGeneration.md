# Code Generation
These aren't necessarily all AI, but they're pretty cool tools for automating upgrades, vulnerability fixes, etc.

## [Pixee](https://docs.pixee.ai/)

Pixeebot uses [Codemodder](https://codemodder.io/) to function as an automated security engineer, finding vulnerabilities in source and generating pull/merge requests with code changes to address them.

## [OpenRewrite](https://github.com/openrewrite)
OpenRewrite is probably more mature and provides tooling for applying "recipes" to a source repo to automate upgrades, etc.

## Claude Code
By [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)

[Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) is a terminal-based coding assistant that also integrates well with IDEs (run in terminal in the IDE). I'm using it almost exclusively at work.  

[Documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview)This is what I'm using, almost exclusively.

## OpenCode
[OpenCode](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) is an open source coding agent that is terminal based and can be used with most/all LLMs, including running LLMs locally.
