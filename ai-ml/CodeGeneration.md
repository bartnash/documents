# Code Generation
These aren't necessarily all AI, but they're pretty cool tools for automating upgrades, vulnerability fixes, etc.

## [Pixee](https://docs.pixee.ai/)

Pixeebot uses [Codemodder](https://codemodder.io/) to function as an automated security engineer, finding vulnerabilities in source and generating pull/merge requests with code changes to address them.

## [OpenRewrite](https://github.com/openrewrite)
OpenRewrite is probably more mature and provides tooling for applying "recipes" to a source repo to automate upgrades, etc.
