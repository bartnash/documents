## Generative AI

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content, such as images, text, or music, by learning patterns and characteristics from existing data.


### ChatGPT
Is a chat interface to a "Generative Pre-trained Transformer." The term "Generative" refers to the model's ability to generate new content, "Pre-trained" indicates that the model is initially trained on a large corpus of text data, and "Transformer" refers to the transformer architecture, which is a key component of the model. The GPT models are designed to generate text by leveraging the knowledge learned during pre-training on vast amounts of text data.

It is base on a model generated with a data set from 2021, so some info will be out of date.

#### Alternatives

	* [CollosalChat](https://chat.colossalai.org/)  Down, couldn't test.
	* Bing chat, only accessible through edge browser. Very limited.  Won't generate code.  Isn't conversational.  Did I install edge on RHEL for this? meh
	* [you.com](https://you.com)Pretty nice.  Seemed to do a better job than ChatGPT of telling me the basics of writing a loop in Python.  The info it gave me lead me to ask questions with naturally progressed deeper into the language.  Let's you fine tune what sources it get's info from.   It is like Bing chat in that it is an AI augmented search engine, but more useful results similar to ChatGPT.  It allows you to like or dislike information sources.  No history of chats, so save it if you get something useful.
	* [bard.google.com] Looks comparable to chatgpt, based on Pathways Language Model 2 (PaLM 2).  In addition to PaLM 2, Bard also uses Google Search to provide users with access to up-to-date information.  Also has IDE plugins.
	
## AI Based Tools

### Github copilot
Generative AI plugin which works with VSCode, Intellij, neovim, etc.
Developed by OpenAI in collaboration with GitHub, powered by OpenAI Codex.  It is a code completion tool and generates code based on comments that you type or the code you have started typing.

It doesn't seem suitable for templating projects or generating more than a few lines of code or functions.



## Tools For Implementing AI

## Hugging face
[Hugging face](https://huggingface.co/) is an open source "AI community" which houses AI models, datasets, etc. and provides ability to share, collaborate and use the models, running on Hugging Face's infrastructure.  It is an "open source Machine Learning movement."
